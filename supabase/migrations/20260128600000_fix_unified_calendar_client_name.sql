-- Migration: Fix unified_calendar view to use primary_client_name
-- Date: 2026-01-28
-- Description: Update our_client_name to use legal_cases.primary_client_name
--              instead of deprecated case_clients table which has no data

-- Drop existing view (required since we're changing columns)
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS unified_calendar;

-- Recreate unified_calendar view with fixed our_client_name

-- ============================================================================
-- Change Summary:
-- 1. Replaced complex case_clients subqueries with simple lc.primary_client_name
-- 2. This fixes the null our_client_name issue since case_clients table is empty
-- 3. primary_client_name in legal_cases is the authoritative source for client names
